# RANDOMIZE
## A shiny app to randomize metadata

High-throughput DNA methylation arrays are sensitive to bias due to batch effects that can alter DNA methylation level estimates. These batch effects are mainly due to improper handling of the samples during the plating process. Batch effects are difficult to remove entirely when the samples are not randomized across chips and plates, thus leading to false detection of differentially methylated probes.

Randomization helps to reduce the likelihood of bias and the impact of differences among groups. Randomizing samples can be a tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming task. To facilitate this process, here we present a web-based tool that helps users to randomize samples in a user-friendly and efficient way. The tool is available online at https://coph-usf.shinyapps.io/RANDOMIZE/ and is free to use.
